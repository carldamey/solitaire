# Solitaire

https://carldamey.github.io/solitaire/

Klondike solitaire is the most commonly known and played version of the Solitaire family of card games. It is fondly remembered by those who grew up on older Windows operating systems, especially those without internet access, as many of these operating systems came with it installed alongside lackluster video editing software and strange royalty-free mp3s.

## MVP

To reach MVP, this project will need:

 - A CSS grid or canvas layout for tableau, deck, and ace piles
 - A system for detecting and executing requested legal moves
 - A system for properly drawing from the deck
 - A system for moving cards to legal spaces

## Stretch Goals

If time permits it, I would like to add:

 - A responsive design
 - Audio feedback
 - Timer & Move Counter
 - Loss Detection
 - Visuals that mimic the Windows 98/XP releases of solitaire
 - Settings for minor gameplay variations such as draw rules or the enforcement of alternating suit colors

## Tech Stack

 - HTML, CSS, JS
 - CSS Card Library
 - VSCodium


## Potential Roadblocks
The biggest difficulties in this project are likely to be:

 - The canvas/grid layout
 - Formatting and displaying cards in their proper layout legibly
 - Implementing a system for detecting whether cards on the tableau should be hidden or visible
